#+TITLE: README

** Features
- Uses LSI model to search for similar sentences
- Index is updated in background by separate worker
- Robust caching on client side
- GraphQL API

** Limitations
- The whole index is stored in RAM, so this will not work for big datasets
- Currently only one instance of background worker is supported
  
** Running
To run production build try the following. This will fetch pre-built images from docker hub.
#+begin_src org :eval never-export
docker-compose up
#+end_src
For development (this will build docker images from source, which may take some time):
#+begin_src org :eval never-export
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
#+end_src

*** Environment Variables
**** Server
| ~SIMTXT_DB_URI~          | URI for Mongo database (default: ~mongodb://localhost:27017~)                                                           |
| ~SIMTXT_INDEX_MIN_SCORE~ | If similarity score is more than this value we are including sentence to the list of similar sentences (default: ~0.1~) |
| ~SIMTXT_LSI_NUM_TOPIC~   | Number of topics for LSI model (default: ~100~)                                                                         |
If you have small dataset and not getting any similar sentences try to change ~SIMTXT_INDEX_MIN_SCORE~ to ~0~ in ~docker-compose.yml~ file
**** Client
| ~REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_URI~ | URI for GraphQL API (default: ~http://localhost:8080/graphql~) |

*** Tests & Linting
#+begin_src org :eval never-export
./lint.sh
./test.sh
#+end_src
