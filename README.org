** Features
- Uses LSI model to search for similar sentences
- Index is updated in background by separate worker
- Robust caching on client side
- GraphQL API

** Limitations
- The whole index is stored in RAM, so this will not work for big datasets
- Currently only one instance of background worker is supported
